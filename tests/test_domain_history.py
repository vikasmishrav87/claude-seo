"""
Tests for scripts/domain_history.py.

Focus: the WHOIS referral chain in `_socket_whois`. It asks IANA for the
authoritative WHOIS server and then connects to whatever host IANA names. WHOIS
is plaintext on port 43, so anyone able to tamper with that response can inject
a `refer:` line pointing at an internal address and turn the fallback into a
port-43 probe of the operator's private network. The referral is now resolved
and validated through url_safety before being dialled.

No network: socket.create_connection is stubbed throughout.
