"""Audit subagent turn-budget and early-write regressions (issues #177, #272).

Reporters found that seo-audit subagents were hitting their `maxTurns` cap on
large sites before ever writing a findings file, so a turn-budget stop threw
away all completed work. The fix has two parts for every subagent
`skills/seo-audit/SKILL.md` can spawn:

1. `maxTurns` raised well above the old defaults (seo-technical was 20,
   seo-content was 15; both need real headroom for a 500-page crawl).
2. An explicit instruction to write a partial findings file after the first
   analysis pass and overwrite it with the complete findings at the end, so
   a maxTurns stop mid-audit still leaves usable output on disk.
